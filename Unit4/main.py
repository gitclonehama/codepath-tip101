Problem 1: Prime Number

Write a function is_prime() that takes in a positive integer n and returns True if it is a prime 
number and False otherwise. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive 
divisors other than 1 and itself.

Understand:
    - Do I need to handle edge cases like n <= 1?
    - What's the most efficient way to check for primality?

Plan:
    - If n <= 1, return False (not prime by definition)
    - If n is 2, return True (the only even prime)
    - If n is divisible by 2, return False (even numbers > 2 aren't prime)
    - Check divisibility for all odd numbers from 3 to sqrt(n)
    - If no divisors found, return True

Problem 2: Two-Pointer Reverse List

Write a function reverse_list() that takes in a list lst and returns elements of the list in 
reverse order. The list should be reversed in-place without using list slicing.

Understand:
    - What does it mean to reverse in-place?
    - How can I use the two-pointer technique for this problem?

Plan:
    - Initialize two pointers: left at the beginning and right at the end
    - While left < right:
        - Swap the elements at left and right indices
        - Increment left and decrement right

""" 
Problem 3: Evaluating Solutions

The reverse_list() problem can also be solved without using the two pointer technique. 
Evaluate the time and space complexity of the two-pointer solution vs. the slice solution.

Understand:
    - How do we analyze time complexity for each solution?
    - How do we analyze space complexity for each solution?

Plan:
    - Compare the two-pointer approach with the slice approach
    - Analyze operations and memory usage for both

"""
# Implement
"""
Two-Pointer Solution Analysis:
Time Complexity: O(n) - we process each element once
Space Complexity: O(1) - we only use a constant amount of extra space

Slice Solution Analysis:
def reverse_list(lst):
    # Create a new reversed list
    reversed_lst = lst[::-1]
    # Copy the elements back into the original list
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        lst[i] = reversed_lst[i]
        
Time Complexity: O(n) - we process each element twice (once for slicing, once for copying)
Space Complexity: O(n) - we create a new list of the same size

Comparison:
- Time Complexity: Both are O(n), but the two-pointer approach has fewer operations
- Space Complexity: Two-pointer is better with O(1) vs O(n) for the slice approach

The two-pointer technique is more efficient in terms of space complexity.

Problem 4: Move Even Integers

Write a function sort_list_by_parity() that takes in an integer list nums as a parameter and moves all the even 
integers at the beginning of the list followed by all the odd integers.

Problem 5: Palindrome

Write a function first_palindrome() that takes in a list of strings words as a parameter and returns the 
first palindromic string in the list.

Understand:

    - What should we return if no palindrome is found in the list?

Problem 6: Remove Duplicates with O(1)

Write a function remove_duplicates() that takes in a sorted list of integers nums as a parameter and

Problem 7: Perfect Number

Write a function is_perfect_number() that takes in a positive integer n and returns True if it is a perfect 
number and False otherwise. A perfect number is a positive integer that equals the sum of its proper divisors.

Understand:
    - What are proper divisors? (Numbers that divide evenly excluding the number itself)
