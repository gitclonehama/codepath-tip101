Problem 1: Is Symmetric Tree
Given the root of a binary tree, return True if the tree's left and right subtrees are mirrors of each other (i.e., tree is symmetric around its center). Return False otherwise.

Understand:
    - How do we define "mirror" of subtrees? Does it mean same structure with identical values?
    - How should we handle null/None nodes? Are they considered symmetric with other null nodes?

Plan:
    - Create a helper function to check if two subtrees are mirrors of each other
    - Two trees are mirrors if:
        - Their root values are the same
        - Left subtree of first tree mirrors right subtree of second tree
        - Right subtree of first tree mirrors left subtree of second tree
    - Use recursion to check each level of the tree

""" 
Problem 2: Root-to-Leaf Paths
Given the root of a binary tree, return a list of all root-to-leaf paths in any order.
A leaf is a node with no children.

Understand:
    - What format should the paths be in? String format with "->" as separator?
    - Should we handle empty trees specially? What should be returned?

Plan:
    - Use a depth-first search (DFS) approach with backtracking
    - Maintain a current path as we traverse the tree
    - When we reach a leaf node (no children), add the current path to our result
    - Use recursion to explore all possible paths from root to leaves

""" 
Problem 3: Minimum Difference in BST
Given the root of a binary search tree, return the minimum difference between the values of any two different nodes in the tree.

Understand:
    - Can we leverage BST properties (all left nodes < parent < all right nodes)?
    - Will there always be at least two nodes in the tree?

Plan:
    - Use in-order traversal of the BST to get values in sorted order
    - Keep track of the previous node's value during traversal
    - Calculate difference between current and previous nodes
    - Update minimum difference if current difference is smaller

""" 
Problem 4: Increasing Order Search Tree
Given the root of a binary search tree, rearrange the tree in in-order so that the leftmost node of the tree is now the root of tree and every node has no left child and only one right child.

Understand:
    - Do we need to create new nodes or reuse existing ones?
    - Should we modify the tree in-place or create a new structure?

Plan:
    - Perform an in-order traversal to visit nodes in ascending order
    - Create a dummy node to start the new tree
    - As we visit each node, set it as the right child of our current position
    - Reset each node's left child to None
    - Advance our current position pointer

""" 
Problem 5: Equal Tree Split
Given the root of a binary tree, return True if removing an edge between two nodes can split the tree into two trees with an equal number of nodes. Return False otherwise.

Understand:
    - Can any edge be removed, or just edges from the root?
    - What happens if the tree has an odd number of nodes?

Plan:
    - Count total nodes in the tree first
    - If total is odd, return False (can't split evenly)

""" 
Problem 6: Level Order Traversal of Binary Tree
Given the following pseudocode and the root of a binary tree, return a list of the level order traversal of it's nodes' values (i.e., from left to right, level by level).

Understand:
    - We need to traverse the tree one level at a time, from top to bottom
    - At each level, we process nodes from left to right before moving to the next level

Plan:
    - Use a queue data structure to track nodes at each level
    - Process the tree using Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach
    - Store visited node values in a result list

""" 
Problem 7: Find Minimum Depth of Binary Tree
Given the root of a binary tree, return its minimum depth. The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root down to the nearest leaf node.

Understand:
    - The minimum depth is the shortest path from root to any leaf node
    - A leaf node is a node with no children (no left and no right child)
    - We need to find the leaf node with the smallest depth

Plan:
    - Use BFS to traverse the tree level by level
    - As soon as we encounter a leaf node, return its depth
    - BFS ensures we find the first leaf node at the minimum depth

    return 0  # Should not reach here if tree is valid

# Time Complexity: O(n) in worst case, where n is the number of nodes in the tree
# In the worst case scenario, the first leaf might be at the maximum depth, requiring us to visit 
# most nodes. However, we often terminate early once we find the first leaf.
